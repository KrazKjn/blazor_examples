    <p>
        This archive showcases a series of engineering wins from my time at Texacoâ€™s Los Angeles refineryâ€”where I led initiatives that redefined SCADA integration, automated fragile infrastructure, and built secure desktop environments from the ground up.

        Each solution reflects a mindset of strategic reuse, operational resilience, and technical empathy. From restoring telemetry across decommissioned systems to building a live management console for domain oversight, these stories demonstrate the depth and clarity I bring to every challenge.
