        <h2>🔧 What Is IT Works?</h2>
        <p>
            IT Works is a modular system designed to manage operating systems and software across Windows-based desktops, laptops, and servers. It was deployed in both business networks and industrial process control environments, providing a foundation of stability, security, and high uptime.

        <h2>💡 Design Philosophy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time = Money:</strong> Investing in quality hardware and software reduces hidden costs from support and downtime.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifecycle Strategy:</strong> 3-year lease model with annual refresh of 1/3 of user systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Persona-Based Reassignment:</strong> Power users received new hardware; refreshed systems were re-personalized for other users.</li>
            <li><strong>Centralized Printing:</strong> Replaced individual inkjets with shared, high-end Color LaserJets—reducing cost and increasing reliability.</li>
            <li><strong>Security First:</strong> Least privilege access model minimized help desk calls and improved system integrity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📈 Real-World Impact</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Consistent user experience across all systems</li>
            <li>Reduced support overhead and downtime</li>
            <li>Improved satisfaction and productivity</li>
            <li>Scalable infrastructure aligned with refresh cycles</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            IT Works wasn’t just a tool—it was a mindset. We didn’t chase cheap. We built systems that worked, day in and day out.

        <h2>🧭 Why the Name “IT Works”?</h2>
        <p>
            The name reflects our mission: We made “IT” work as it should. And yes, it just works. That dual meaning became a mantra for our team and our clients.

        <h2>🔄 Legacy and Modernization</h2>
        <p>
            While IT Works was originally built for Windows environments, its principles remain timeless. The architecture could be modernized for cross-platform relevance, and its persona-based automation model is more applicable than ever in today’s hybrid work environments.

        <h2>🚀 What’s Next?</h2>
        <p>
            As I pivot into AI education and consulting, IT Works serves as a proof point of what thoughtful infrastructure can achieve. It’s a legacy I’m proud of—and a foundation for what’s possible when we combine strategy, empathy, and technical excellence.
