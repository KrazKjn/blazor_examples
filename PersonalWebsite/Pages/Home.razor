                    I’m <strong>Mark J. Hogan</strong>, a Software Engineering Manager, Architect, and Developer with over two decades of leadership in backend systems, product modernization, and team mentorship. This site—built in <em>Blazor</em>—is where I share ideas, projects, and my commitment to resilient, user-focused technology.
                </p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Software Engineering Manager and Architect, I specialize in building scalable enterprise platforms, modernizing legacy systems, and leading teams to deliver reliable, maintainable solutions. With over 20 years in regulated industries, I’ve guided backend transformations, driven CI/CD adoption, and architected API ecosystems that balance performance with clarity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My experience spans:
                <ul>
                    <li>React + .NET Core modernization using Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) design</li>
                    <li>CI/CD adoption, defect elimination, and velocity optimization</li>
                    <li>REST API ecosystems for real-time healthcare asset tracking</li>
                    <li>Disaster recovery logic and planning</li>
                    <li>Automation-first engineering philosophy using PowerShell, GitHub Actions, and Copilot-assisted reviews</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whether mentoring engineers or reimagining legacy architecture, I bring a systems-thinking mindset that combines technical rigor with user empathy. I believe great software should disappear into the background—quietly solving problems and empowering the people who rely on it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The passion runs deeper than code—I invest in engineers, coach clarity, and create systems that empower people and outlast trends.
                </p>
