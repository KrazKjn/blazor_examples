Publishing a Blazor app to GitHub requires a combination of preparing your Blazor application for production and utilizing GitHub Pages to host it. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you deploy your Blazor app to GitHub:

1. Prepare Your Blazor App
Ensure your Blazor app is ready for deployment:

Open your Blazor project in Visual Studio or your preferred editor.

Set the base tag in the wwwroot/index.html (for Blazor WebAssembly) or wwwroot/_Host.cshtml (for Blazor Server). Update it for GitHub Pages:

html
<base href="/my-personal-blazor-website/" />
Replace / with /<repository-name>/ (e.g., /my-blazor-app/) if you're deploying to a repository with its own name.

2. Add an empty file named .nojekyllto the root of wwwroot
This instructs GitHub to serve up the requested _framework files.

3. Publish the Application
Build the app in Release mode to produce the production-ready files.

Use the following command in the terminal if you are working with the .NET CLI:

bash
dotnet publish -c Release
For Blazor WebAssembly, the output will be in the bin/Release/net7.0/publish/wwwroot folder (depending on your .NET version).

4. Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and create a new repository.

Clone the repository to your local machine if you havenâ€™t already:

bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
cd <repository-name>

5. Copy Files to the Repository
Copy the contents of the wwwroot folder (from the publish output) into the cloned repository folder.

6. Commit and Push to GitHub
Add the files to the GitHub repository:

bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy Blazor app"
git push origin main

7. Configure GitHub Pages
Go to your repository on GitHub.

Click on Settings > Pages (usually under the "Code and Automation" section).

In the Source dropdown, select the branch (main or other) and directory (usually root).

Save the settings. GitHub Pages will now host your Blazor app.

8. Access Your Deployed App
The URL for your app will typically look like this:

https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
Example: https://markhogan.github.io/my-blazor-app/

Additional Notes
If your app doesn't display correctly, double-check the <base> tag in your Blazor app, as it must match the GitHub Pages URL path.

For automatic deployment, consider using GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process on every commit.
